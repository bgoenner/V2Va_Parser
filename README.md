# V2Va_Parser

This is tool that is used to convert Verilog netlists for microfluidic design automation (MFDA) to a useable netlist for HSPICE and XYCE.

The HSPICE components are considered legacy currently and no longer being worked on.


Arguments

The Current supported function is Verilog2Xyce_from_config()

Verilog2Xyce_from_config( inputVerilogFile, configFile, SolnInputList, remoteTestPath, libraryFile=None, devList=None, length_file=None, simTimesList=None, preRouteSim=None, outputVerilogFile=None, runScript=True)
inputVerilogFile        - verilog netlist to parse
configFile              - a simulation configuration file that defines external hardware behavior
solnInputList           - autogenerated dictionary of input chemicals with structure {chemical: ChemInput}; the ChemInput class has [chemical name, input port, input concentration]
remoteTestPath          - Used in HSPICE implementation [to be removed]
libraryFile=None        - A CSV file of list of all VA library components avalible with any standard parameters
devList=None            - Python dictionary of hardware components at the device inputs with structure {<input_node>: {'dev':<device>, 'args':<args>}}, args must be completely spelled out as <<parameter>=<value>>
length_file=None        - input xlsx file containing list of "wire" lengths connecting components
simTimesList=None       - Python dictionary of simulation parameters, currently only supports transient. {'transient': [parameters]}. parameters are those defined by .tran
preRouteSim=None        - If true, builds netlist without additional routing channel lengths
outputVerilogFile=None  - Used in HSPICE implementation [to be removed]
runScript=True          - Used in HSPICE implementation [to be removed]
